# Loan data exploration
## by Mohamed Laayouni


## Dataset

> From a preliminary analysis, this dataset seems to contain 113,937 datapoints pertaining to borrowers information distrubted across 81 features. The main features in this dataset are:
CurrentCreditLines, LoanStatus & CreditGrade


## Summary of Findings

> What i found during my analysis of this dataset is that most borrowers are prone to have around 10 open current lines at any given time, with an average of 20 open credit lines in the past 7 years. These same borrowers are also most likely to reside in one of the following states: CA, NY or TX.
The vast majority of them are employed and are initiating loans with an income range of $50k-75k. And these borrowers are more likely to have their credit grade either a C, B or D


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The key insights i have gathered fromt this dataset and which i will be explaining in the slide deck pertain to the distribution of borrowers across states in the US in this dataset as well as the impact some features in this dataset, notably open credit lines and open credit lines in the last 7 years have on a borrowers credit grade.
